					<p class="mt-40 mt-sm-10">Recently, researchers have found an alternative packaging method: fungus. Though it may sound off-putting, this means of packaging is more environment-friendly. It would also be beneficial as a replacement of plastic, serving many of the same purposes in terms of flexibility, elasticity, and strength.</p>
					<br></br>

					<p class="mb-50">The concept is quite simple. A fungal spore, which is the seed from which more fungus can grow, is introduced to a partial wooden 3-D print, that being a incomplete model of the desired product.</p>

					<p>In the picture above, there would have first been a partial print, where the skeletal structure of the product is printed with wood. The spore is then left alone for a few weeks in a controlled environment. In this time, it is able to replace the wood, and change the partial print into a completed print. The product then undergoes baking, and is then able to be used as packaging, or a replacement for conventional plastic products.</p>

					<p>This product is superior to plastic, as it uses less energy, produces fewer emissions and is biodegradable, meaning it would be much easier to use as a one-time product, such as packaging, bowls, and as cork, which is one of the most versatile wood products that exist. On top of this, the product is lighter and cheaper to produce, as there are essentially no costs past controlling the environment in which the fungus grows and running an oven to kill the live spores.</p>

					<p>The product is currently being tried out in numerous markets, majorly in packaging, at this product reduces shipping costs, due to its light weight; furthermore, safety of the product being transported, can be improbed as lighter packaging means more packaging can be used, allowing for lower chances of damage while transporting. Though the product is not yet at the forefront of the packaging industry, it is sure to replace plastic to some extent in the future.</p>
