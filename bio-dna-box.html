					<p class="mt-40 mt-sm-10">Bensalem, a suburb in Bucks County near Philadelphia, is revolutionizing the methods of solving crimes. In early 2017, the police booking station in Bensalem became the first in the United States to install a Rapid DNA machine, an equipment which allows police to learn whether a suspect’s DNA matches previously collected crime-scene DNA in a record time of 90 minutes.</p>
					<br></br>

					<p class="mb-50">The once dream-like future in which police can immediately identify robbers and murderers from cigarette butts and crushed soda cans has finally arrived. In 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Rapid DNA Act into law, which will permit approved police booking stations in several states to connect their Rapid DNA machines to Codis, the national DNA database. This is paving the road to a future where genetic fingerprinting is set to become old-fashioned, however unbelievable this may be.</p><br></br>

					<p>According to U.S. law-enforcement personnel, the device has helped solve hundreds of cases, helping to facilitate arrests and exonerate falsely accused individuals. Some robbers in Orange Country, California were identified so quickly that they were caught red-handed, still in the possession of stolen goods. These machines were even used to help identify the victims of the recent wildfires in Northern California.</p><br></br>

					<p>But this ‘Magic Box’ is not without its fair share of concerns. Many legal experts and scientists are troubled by how the technology is being used. Until now, while establishing their local DNA databases, the police have collected DNA from people who have been charged with major crimes. However, DNA is increasingly being collected from people who are merely deemed suspicious; this is permanently linking their genetic identities to criminal databases.</p><br></br>

					<p>Furthermore, it is difficult to reach consensus on which types of genetic material should be analyzed by the device. Critics say that genetic evidence may be rendered useless if handled by nonexperts. Police officers also risk being misled by the results of Rapid DNA analysis. Peter Stout, president of the Houston Forensic Science Center, says that now is the moment to address the flaws of the Rapid DNA system.</p><br></br>

					<p>“We need fast and cheap,” said Dr. Stout. “It also needs to be right.”</p>
