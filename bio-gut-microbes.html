					<p class="mt-40 mt-sm-10">According to a study published on March 8, 2019 in Science, researchers observed that certain filamentous microbes in mice use a hook-like appendage to send messages that researchers believe are aimed at preventing immune cells from attacking the microbes.</p><br></br>

					<p class="mb-50">However, much like cells, proteins aren’t 100% reliable. Certain proteins can assume a ‘misfolded’ structure that does harm instead of good. Known as prions, these baffling yet mischievous proteins cause neurodegenerative diseases that are infectious and fatal.</p>

					<p>This finding could help explain how immune systems distinguish harmless gut bacteria from pathogens, says microbiologist Primrose Freestone of the University of Leicester in England, who was not involved in the research.</p><br></br>

					<p>The intestine is stocked with immune cells ready for action because the gut is an easy gateway for microbes to infect a person or other animal. Although researchers have examined how immune cells like T cells detect and attack pathogens like E. coli, it’s unclear how the immune cells manage to identify gut microbes that help with digestion and not attack them.</p><br></br>

					<p>Immunologist Ivaylo Ivanov at Columbia University and his fellow researchers examined segmented filamentous bacteria, bacteria found in the intestines of many animals like mice, fish and humans. These symbiotic gut microbes have a hook-like appendage called a holdfast that attaches them to cells on the walls of the intestines.</p><br></br>

					<p>Regarding the vesicles in the image above, Ivanov stated that “This was something nobody had noticed before.” Chemical tests revealed that the vesicles contained the bacteria’s antigens — proteins that immune cells use to recognize a foreign body. Immune cells usually recognize pathogens using the antigens on their surfaces and attack them. However, in this case, although T cells were activated, they didn’t pursue the bacteria.</p><br></br>

					<p>“We’re maybe looking at some new biology,” Ivanov says. “I was not expecting to identify a new type of interaction.”</p><br></br>

					<p>He suggests that a T cell’s response may depend on how the antigens are presented. For example, the cell may read antigens differently if they are packaged within vesicles released in gut cells rather than exposed on the surface of the invading microbe.</p><br></br>

					<p>It’s unknown whether this process is suppressing the immune response, and if other gut microbiota might use similar forms of communication. Freestone says this “is a nice step in terms of understanding the mechanism.” However, “there’s still more work to do.”</p><br></br>
