					<p class="mt-40 mt-sm-10">Living on a planet has a lot of advantages, like gravity to keep us from flying into space and an atmosphere to protect us from solar radiation. But, what if an advanced civilization ran out of room to grow on their home planet? What if they ran out of energy to keep themselves going? Well, their best option might be to build settlements in space to capture more of their star’s energy. Not another planet though - it could be a large structure which just floats in space. There’s a whole field of science that deals with how that might work, and it’s called astroengineering.</p>

					<h3 class="mtb-50"><b>“The concepts proposed in the field are extremely radical and hypothetical. One of the most famous concepts is the Dyson sphere, an object that is able to capture the majority of a star’s light and convert it into useful energy.”</b></h3>


					<p class="mb-50">It is named after Freeman Dyson, an astrophysicist who proposed it in 1960. He pointed out that only a small amount of the output energy from the sun is directed towards Earth, and the rest is dissipated into space. In order to harness more energy from the star, a Dyson sphere can be built around it.</p>

					<p>The original idea was to encase the whole star in a megastructure to capture its power output. A solid shell enveloping the sun is probably not the way to go, as such a large body is vulnerable to collisions with shattering outer space debris. Not to mention, the building resources required to build an entire dome structure around the sun is incomprehensible and requires more material than is available in the solar system.</p>

					<p>Seeing this, astroengineers conceptualized a more plausible structure: a Dyson swarm. It uses the same concept as a Dyson Sphere, but it includes a swarm of enormous orbiting panels - instead of a single megastructure - collect sun’s light energy and redirect it for conversion into useful energy.</p>

					<p>This would provide tangibly unlimited energy, but building it is still problematic. The sun itself is a large celestial object, and under the assumption that each panel is 1km2 in area, we would require 30 quadrillion of them to surround the sun. Even if they are built as efficiently as possible, humans would still require 100 quintillion tons of building material as well as the enormous energy to place those panels into orbit around the sun.</p>

					<p>In order to build a Dyson sphere, we’ll need the power output of a Dyson Sphere, which is a classic case of the chicken and the egg.</p>

					<p class="mt-50">Thus, the concept of the Dyson Sphere remains imagined. Although it’s a hypothetical structure, it may not be so for other civilizations. Based on the Fermi Paradox, there are hypothetically thousands of technologically advanced civilizations. Some of which may have built one, this would produce large amounts of heat in the infrared spectrum, thus astronomers are scanning space for unusual infrared spikes in order to detect alien life.</p>
